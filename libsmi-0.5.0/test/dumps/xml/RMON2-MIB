        The MIB module for managing remote monitoring
        device implementations.  This MIB module
        extends the architecture introduced in the original
        RMON MIB as specified in RFC 2819.
        
        Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2006).  This version of
        this MIB module is part of RFC 4502;  see the RFC itself for
        full legal notices.

      <description>
          This version updates the proposed-standard version of the
          RMON2 MIB (published as RFC 2021) by adding 2 new
          enumerations to the nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase object and
          4 new enumerations to the alMatrixTopNControlRateBase object.
          These new enumerations support the creation of high-capacity
          topN reports in the High Capacity RMON MIB [RFC3273].
          
          Additionally, the following objects have been deprecated, as
          they have not had enough independent implementations to
          demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a
          Draft Standard:
          
          probeDownloadFile
          probeDownloadTFTPServer
          probeDownloadAction
          probeDownloadStatus

          tokenRingPStats2CreateTime
          ringStationControl2DroppedFrames
          ringStationControl2CreateTime
          sourceRoutingStats2DroppedFrames
          sourceRoutingStats2CreateTime
          trapDestIndex
          trapDestCommunity
          trapDestProtocol
          trapDestAddress
          trapDestOwner
          trapDestStatus
          
          In addition, two corrections were made.  The LastCreateTime
          Textual Convention had been defined with a base type of
          another textual convention, which isn't allowed in SMIv2.  The
          definition has been modified to use TimeTicks as the base
          type.
          
          Further, the SerialConfigEntry SEQUENCE definition included
          sub-typing information that is not allowed in SMIv2.  This
          information has been deleted.  Ranges were added to a number of
          objects and textual-conventions to constrain their maximum
          (and sometimes minimum) sizes.  The addition of these ranges
          documents existing practice for these objects.  These objects
          
          
          
          are:
              ControlString
              protocolDirID
              protocolDirParameters
              addressMapNetworkAddress
              nlHostAddress
              nlMatrixSDSourceAddress
              nlMatrixSDDestAddress
              nlMatrixDSSourceAddress
              nlMatrixDSDestAddress
              nlMatrixTopNSourceAddress
              nlMatrixTopNDestAddress
              alHostEntry
              alMatrixSDEntry
              alMatrixDSEntry
              alMatrixTopNSourceAddress
              alMatrixTopNDestAddress
          
          Finally, the TimeFilter TC has been updated to encourage agent
          implementations that allow a MIB walk to behave well even when
          performed by an application that is not aware of the special
          TimeFilter semantics.

          This TC describes an object that counts events with the
          following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
          zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
          events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
          reached.
          
          Provided that an application discovers the new object within
          the minimum time to wrap, it can use the initial value as a
          delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
          part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
          this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
          discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
          defined minimum time.
          
          Typically, this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
          constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use.

      <description>
          This TC describes an object that stores the value of the
          sysUpTime object at the last time its entry was created.
          
          This can be used for polling applications to determine that an
          entry has been deleted and re-created between polls, causing
          an otherwise undetectable discontinuity in the data.
          
          If sysUpTime is reset to zero as a result of a re-
          initialization of the network management (sub)system, then
          the values of all LastCreateTime objects are also reset.
          However, after approximately 497 days without a re-
          initialization, the sysUpTime object will reach 2^^32-1 and
          then increment to zero; in this case, existing values
          of TimeStamp objects do not change.  This can lead to
          ambiguities in the value of TimeStamp objects.

          To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
          to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
          
          
          
          Note that this is not a history mechanism.  Only current values
          of underlying objects are returned; saved instance values
          associated with particular values of sysUpTime are not.
          
          An entry is considered changed if the value of any object in the
          entry changes, if the row is created, or if any object in the
          entry is created or deleted.  Note that deleted entries cannot
          be detected or downloaded.
          
          A time-filtered conceptual table is created by inserting a
          single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX component
          in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any
          SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component).  Thus, for
          each conceptual entry 'I' in the basic table, there exists N
          conceptual entries in the time-filtered version, indexed N.I,
          where 'N' is equal to the value of sysUpTime.
          
          When an application retrieves conceptual instances from a
          time-filtered table, and an INDEX value is provided for the
          TimeFilter INDEX component 'N', the agent will only consider
          returning basic conceptual entries (e.g., 'fooColumn.N.I') if
          any column within the basic conceptual entry has changed since
          sysUpTime 'N'.  If not, the basic conceptual entry will
          be ignored for the particular retrieval operation.
          
          When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.
          
          One conceptual entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime,
          except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.
          
          As an entry in a time-filtered table is updated (i.e., one of
          the columns in the basic conceptual table is changed), new
          conceptual entries are also created in the time-filtered version
          (which still shares the now updated object values with all other
          instances).  The number of unique time-filtered instances that
          are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the
          basic entry was last updated.  One unique instance will exist
          for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.
          However, a new TimeFilter index instance is created for each new
          sysUpTime value.  The TimeFilter index values not associated
          with entry updates are called duplicate time-filtered instances.
          
          After some deployment experience, it has been determined that
          a time-filtered table is more efficient if the agent
          stops a MIB walk operation by skipping over rows with a
          TimeFilter index value higher than the value in the received
          GetNext/GetBulk request.  That is, instead of incrementing a
          TimeFilter index value, the agent will continue to the next
          
          
          
          object or table.  As a consequence, GetNext or GetBulk
          operations will provide only one pass through a time-filtered
          table.
          
          It is suggested that an agent implement a time-filtered table
          in this manner to improve performance and avoid a MIB walk
          getting stuck in time-filtered tables.  It is, however, still
          acceptable for an agent to implement a time-filtered table in
          the traditional manner (i.e., every conceptual time-filtered
          instance is returned in GetNext and GetBulk PDU responses), and
          management applications must be able to deal with such
          traditional implementations.
          
          See the appendix for further discussion of this textual
          convention.
          
          The following example is provided to demonstrate TimeFilter
          behavior:
          
          Consider the following basic conceptual table, basicFooTable.
          (Note that the basic version of a time-filtered table may not
          actually be defined.)
          
              basicFooTable:
          
              basicFooTable ...
              INDEX { fooIndex }
          
              BasicFooEntry {
                 fooIndex     Integer32,
                 fooCounts    Counter32
              }
          
          For this example, the basicFooTable contains two static
          conceptual entries (fooIndex equals '1' and '2'), created at
          time zero.  It also contains one dynamic conceptual entry
          (fooIndex equals '3'), which is created at time '3' and deleted
          at time '7'.
          
          The time-filtered version of the basicFooTable could be defined
          as follows:
          
              FooTable:
          
              fooTable ...
              INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }
          
              FooEntry {
          
          
          
                 fooTimeMark  TimeFilter,
                 fooIndex     Integer32,
                 fooCounts    Counter32
              }
          
          
          Note that entries exist in the time-filtered conceptual table
          only if they actually exist in the underlying (basic) table.
          
          For this example, the fooTable will have three underlying
          basic entries (fooIndex == 1, 2, and 3), with the following
          activity (for sysUpTime equal 0 to 9):
          
             - fooEntry.N.1 is created at time '0' and most recently
               updated at time '6' to the value '5'.
             - fooEntry.N.2 is created at time '0' and most recently
               updated at time '8' to the value '9'.
             - fooEntry.N.3 is created at time '3', updated at time '5'
               to the value '17', and deleted at time '7'.
          
          The following tables show the values that would be returned for
          MIB walk operations with various TimeFilter values, done at
          different times.  An application issues a retrieval request at
          time 'T', with a TimeFilter value, 'N' (typically set to a lower
          value, such as the value of sysUpTime at the last polling cycle).
          
          The following values would be returned in a MIB walk of
          fooCounts.N if T equals '0' and N equals '0':
          
               fooCounts.N.I    Value
               ==========================
               fooCounts.0.1    0
               fooCounts.0.2    0
          
           Note that nothing is returned for fooCounts.0.3, since that
           entry does not exist at sysUpTime equals '0'.
          
          The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB
          walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '3' and N equals '0':
          
               fooCounts.N.I    Value
               =======================
               fooCounts.0.1    0
               fooCounts.0.2    0
               fooCounts.0.3    0
               fooCounts.1.3    0
               fooCounts.2.3    0
               fooCounts.3.3    0
          
          
          
           Note that there are no instances for T equals 1 or 2 for the
           first two values of N, as these entries did not change
           since they were created at time '0'.
          
           Note that the current value for 'fooCounts.N.3' is returned
           here, even for values of N less than '3' (when the entry was
           created).  The agent only considers the current existence of an
           entry in the TimeFilter algorithm, not the time when the entry
           was created.
          
           Note that the instances 'fooCounts.0.3', 'fooCounts.1.3',
           and 'fooCounts.2.3' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
           agent in a MIB walk.
          
          The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
          MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '6' and N equals '3':
          
               fooCounts.N.I    Value
               =======================
               fooCounts.3.1    5
               fooCounts.3.3    17
               fooCounts.4.1    5
               fooCounts.4.3    17
               fooCounts.5.1    5
               fooCounts.5.3    17
               fooCounts.6.1    5
          
            Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.2' are returned,
            since it has not changed since time '3'.
          
            Note that all instances except 'fooCounts.5.3' and
            'fooCounts.6.1' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
            agent in a MIB walk.
          
          The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
          MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '9' and N equals '6':
          
               fooCounts.N.I    Value
               =======================
               fooCounts.6.1    5
               fooCounts.6.2    9

          Identifies the source of the data that the associated
          function is configured to analyze.  This source can be any
          interface on this device.
          
          In order to identify a particular interface, this
          object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex
          object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface.
          
          For example, if an entry were to receive data from
          interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.

    <typedef name="ControlString" basetype="OctetString" status="current">
      <range min="0" max="255"/>
      <description>
          This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a
          
          
          
          serial data switch.  A ControlString contains embedded
          commands to control how the device will interact with the
          remote device through the serial interface.  Commands are
          represented as two-character sequences beginning with
          the '^' character.
          
          The following commands are recognized by the device (note
          that command characters are case sensitive):
          
             ^s  Send string that follows, which is terminated by the
                 next command or the end of string.
             ^c  Delay for the number of seconds that follows.  Toss
                 out any data received rather than store it in a
                 buffer for parsing.
             ^t  Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal
                 digits that follow.  The default timeout is 20
                 seconds.  Note that this timeout may be overridden
                 by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the
                 associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).
             ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows, which is
                 terminated by the next command or the end of string.
                 Partial and case-insensitive matching is applied, i.e.,
                 if the reply string (any case combination) is found
                 anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
                 found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
                 then the remaining control string is ignored.
             ^!  The ^ character.
             ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal
                 digits that follow.
             ^b  Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by
                 the decimal digits that follow.  If no digits follow,
                 break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default.
          
          The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into
          the '^s' send string or the '^w' reply string:
          
             ^@    0x00
             ^A    0x01
              ..
             ^M    0x0D
              ..
             ^Z    0x1A
             ^[    0x1B
             ^    0x1C
             ^]    0x1D
             ^^    0x1E
             ^_    0x1F
          
          
          
          
          Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The
          control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where
          ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two
          ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the '^0x'
          control prefix.  For example, '^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a
          carriage return followed by a line feed.

              When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that
              it is associated with performs the following operations on
              every packet:
              
              1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry
                 identified by this object, discard the packet and exit
                 (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified
                 protocol).
              
              
              
              2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero
                 and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory
                 entry identified by that object, discard the packet and
                 exit.
              3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter
                 algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is
                 the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the
                 filterOffset value to move further into the packet.

            An example of the indexing of this entry is
            protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the

            Note that some combinations of index values may result in an
            index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds
            the maximum for the SNMP protocol.  Implementations should take
            care to avoid such combinations.

              A unique identifier for a particular protocol.  Standard
              identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they
              
              
              
              can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e.,
              a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the
              protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic
              assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees.  See RFC 2074 for
              more details.
              
              Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place
              entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect.  In
              other words, it need not populate this table with all
              possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on
              the fly when it sees them.  Whether it does these
              things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit,
              usability) and is up to the designer of the product.
              
              If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that
              the agent doesn't understand, either directly or
              algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an
              inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.

              Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional
              set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of
              parameters for a node is optional).  The proper parameter
              value for each node is included in this string.  Note that the
              inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is
              not optional.  What is optional is that a node may have no
              parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that
              node will be zero.

              This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol
              directory entry.
              
              The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes
              whether this protocol directory entry can be extended
              by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are
              children of this protocol.
              
              An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
              
              
              
              'ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
              of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'.
              A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
              children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
              table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
              probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for
              which the probe does have built-in support),
              that child node is not extendable.  This is termed 'limited
              extensibility'.
              
              When a child node is added through this extensibility
              mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
              protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.
              
              The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
              manager who is creating the new entry.
              
              This object also describes whether this agent can
              recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a
              network-level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able
              to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol
              and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to
              recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate
              network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses
              in this protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will
              recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and
              populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix
              tables with these protocols.
              
              Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
              values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
              with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
              usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
              bits will usually be set to zero.

              This object describes and configures the probe's support for

              it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have
              the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or
              if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol.  When
              an entry is created in this table by a management operation as
              part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set
              this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility
              of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting
              addresses of the extended protocols.
              
              If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
              will not perform address mapping for this protocol and
              shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value.
              If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe
              supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured
              to perform address mapping for this protocol for all
              addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces.
              If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe

              Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to
              supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in

              probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both
              the nlHostTable and the alHostTable.
              
              If the associated protocolDirType object has the

              for this protocol and is configured to track both tables
              for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces.
              If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe
              supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this

              directory entries, one for the network address and one for the

          Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics
          tables.
          
          Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored
          interface upon initialization so that a default collection
          of protocol statistics is available.
          
          Rationale:
          This table controls collection of very basic statistics
          for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface.
          An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth
          allocation utilized by different protocols.
          
          A media-specific statistics collection could also
          be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain
          total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same
          interface.

              object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex
              object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface.
              For example, if an entry were to receive data from

            A conceptual row in the nlHostTable.
            
            The hlHostControlIndex value in the index identifies the
            hlHostControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created.
            The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the
            network layer protocol of the nlHostAddress.
            
            An example of the indexing of this entry is
            nlHostOutPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.
            
            Note that some combinations of index values may result in an
            index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds
            the maximum for the SNMP protocol.  Implementations should take

              The network destination address for this
              nlMatrixSDEntry.
              
              This is represented as an octet string with
              specific semantics and length as identified
              by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index.
              
              For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an
              
              
              
              encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length
              octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address,
              in network byte order.

              The maximum number of matrix entries in this report.
              
              When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is
              created or modified, the probe should set this
              object as closely to the requested value as
              possible for the particular implementation and
              available resources.  The probe must not lower this
              value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated
              nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object.
              
              If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to
              nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated,
              matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate
              shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate
              until there is no more room or until there are no more
              matrix entries.
              
              If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to
              nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated,
              matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate
              shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate
              until there is no more room or until there are no more
              matrix entries.
              
              It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the
              same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are
              sorted.  It is also an implementation-specific matter as to
              
              
              
              whether zero-valued entries are available.

              the usrHistoryTable associated with this
              usrHistoryControlEntry.
              
              When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested
              object is created or modified, the probe should set
              this object as closely to the requested value as
              possible for the particular probe implementation and
              available resources.  The probe must not lower this
              value except as a result of a modification to the associated
              usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object.
              
              The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object
              should be set before or at the same time as this object
              to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources
              required for this usrHistoryControlEntry.
              
              There will be times when the actual number of buckets
              associated with this entry is less than the value of
              this object.  In this case, at the end of each sampling
              interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable.
              
              When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object
              and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable,
              the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry
              shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be
              added.
              
              When the value of this object changes to a value less than
              the current value, entries are deleted from the
              usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry.
              Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the
              agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the
              new value of this object.
              
              When the value of this object changes to a value greater
              than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory
              entries may be allowed to grow.

              Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of
              Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be
              sampled.
              
              Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
              of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism
              exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify
              only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view.
              Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the
              read access that could be obtained through the user history
              mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this
              object in those views that have read access to all objects on
              the probe.  See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more
              information.
              
              During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not
              available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be

              Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay
