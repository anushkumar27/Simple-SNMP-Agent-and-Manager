Assignments for ibrpib
----------------------

As long as Standard PIBs are being developed and temporarily published
in Internet-Drafts, we have assigned them to OIDs under TUBS-SMI::ibrpib.
Once, when the documents are published officially as RFCs and get IANA
assigned OID registrations (or when they are dropped), they will be
deprecated from this list.
